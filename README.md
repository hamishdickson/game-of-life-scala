# Conway's game of life in scala

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hamishdickson/game-of-life-scala.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hamishdickson/game-of-life-scala)

I am in the process of learning scala, as part of that I've been writing Conway's game of life (ideally in TDD if to
give me a chance of learning unit testing in scala at the same time)

Health warning: This is likely to be ugly code - probably not a good thing if you're looking for examples of nice scala or scalatest
