# Conway's game of life in scala

I am in the process of learning scala, as part of that I've been writing Conway's game of life (ideally in TDD if to
give me a chance of learning unit testing in scala at the same time)

Health warning: This is likely to be ugly code - probably not a good thing if you're looking for examples of nice scala or scalatest
